# Mulher Gorda

## Download parts
Click the PDF-formatted part that you want. Then, click the "Raw" button near the top-right corner of the part. In some browsers, this might open the PDF in a separate tab, requiring you to then save it from there.

## Print parts
I recommend downloading the part, then printing from your PDF viewer.

This link should take you to hear the arrangement in your browser. Some browsers might download the file instead of, or before, playing it.
