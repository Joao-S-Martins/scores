# Bailinho da Madeira

## Download parts
Click the PDF-formatted part that you want. Then, click the "Raw" button near the top-right corner of the part. In some browsers, this might open the PDF in a separate tab, requiring you to then save it from there.

## Print parts
I recommend downloading the part, then printing from your PDF viewer.
